# Evaluation Spec — Pod Classifier

Complete this spec **before** writing any code for Milestone 3.

Use Plan or Ask mode to think through each blank field. When you're done,
your answers here become the blueprint for `compute_accuracy()` and
`compute_per_class_accuracy()` in `evaluate.py`.

## Background: What is evaluation?

After building a classifier, we need to know how well it works. Evaluation answers:
- **Overall:** What fraction of episodes did we classify correctly?
- **Per-class:** Are we better at some labels than others?

Both functions take the same inputs: a list of predicted labels and a list of
ground-truth labels, in the same order.

---

## compute_accuracy(predictions, ground_truth)

### What it does
Returns the fraction of predictions that exactly match the ground truth.

### Inputs

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `predictions` | `list[str]` | Labels predicted by `classify_episode()`, one per episode. |
| `ground_truth` | `list[str]` | The correct labels, in the same order as `predictions`. |

### Output

| Return value | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| accuracy | `float` | A value between 0.0 and 1.0. |

---

### Spec fields — fill these in before writing code

**Formula:**

```
[blank — write out the accuracy formula in plain English.
 What counts as "correct"? What do you divide by?]
```
Accuracy is True Positive + True Negative divided by True Positive + False Positive + True Negative + False Negative.
A label is correct if the model evaluates the podcast accurately after considering the podcast description.
---

**Step-by-step logic:**

```
[blank — describe the steps your code will take.
 1. ...
 2. ...
 3. ...]
```

---

**Edge case — what if both lists are empty?**

```
[blank — what should the function return? Why?]
```
---

**Worked example:**

```
predictions  = ["interview", "solo", "panel", "interview"]
ground_truth = ["interview", "solo", "solo",  "narrative"]

[blank — what does compute_accuracy() return for these inputs? Show your work.]
```

---

## compute_per_class_accuracy(predictions, ground_truth)

### What it does
Returns accuracy broken down by each label. For each label in `VALID_LABELS`,
reports how many episodes with that ground-truth label were classified correctly.

### Inputs

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `predictions` | `list[str]` | Labels predicted by `classify_episode()`. |
| `ground_truth` | `list[str]` | Correct labels, in the same order. |

### Output

A `dict` keyed by label. Each value is a dict with three keys:

```python
{
    "interview": {"correct": int, "total": int, "accuracy": float},
    "solo":      {"correct": int, "total": int, "accuracy": float},
    "panel":     {"correct": int, "total": int, "accuracy": float},
    "narrative": {"correct": int, "total": int, "accuracy": float},
}
```

---

### Spec fields — fill these in before writing code

**What does "correct" mean for a given class?**

```
[blank — be precise. When does an episode count as correctly classified
 for the "interview" class, for example?]
```

---

**What does "total" mean for a given class?**

```
[blank — is "total" the total number of predictions, or something more specific?]
```

---

**Step-by-step logic:**

```
[blank — describe the steps your code will take.
 1. Initialize ...
 2. Loop over ...
 3. For each pair (predicted, truth) ...
 4. After the loop ...
 5. Return ...]
```

---

**Edge case — what if a class has no examples in ground_truth (total == 0)?**

```
[blank — what should accuracy be set to? Why?
 Hint: look at the docstring in evaluate.py.]
```

---

**Worked example:**

```
predictions  = ["interview", "interview", "solo", "panel", "panel"]
ground_truth = ["interview", "solo",      "solo", "panel", "narrative"]

[blank — fill in the per-class results table below]

label       correct  total  accuracy
----------  -------  -----  --------
interview   [blank]  [blank]  [blank]
solo        [blank]  [blank]  [blank]
panel       [blank]  [blank]  [blank]
narrative   [blank]  [blank]  [blank]
```

## Reflection questions (discuss at the checkpoint)

1. Your overall accuracy might be decent even if one class has very low accuracy.
   Why is per-class accuracy a more informative metric than overall accuracy alone?

2. If `panel` episodes consistently get misclassified as `interview`, what does
   that tell you about your training labels or your prompt?

3. You labeled 20 training episodes and evaluated on 20 test episodes (5 per class).
   How might the evaluation results change if you had labeled 100 training episodes?
   What if you had 200 test episodes?
